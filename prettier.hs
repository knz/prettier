-- Here <> is the associative operation that concatenates two documents,

-- The function text converts a string to the corresponding document, and
-- the document line denotes a line break;
-- we adopt the convention that the string passed to text does not contain newline characters,
-- so that line is always used for this purpose.
-- The function nest adds indentation to a document.

align :: DOC -> DOC
align d = COLUMN $
          \k -> NESTING $
          \i -> nest (k - i) d

-- The <|> operator forms the union of the two sets of layouts.
-- The flatten operator replaces each line break (and its associated indentation) by a single space.
-- A document always represents a non-empty set of layouts,
-- where all layouts in the set flatten to the same layout.
-- As an invariant, we require in (x <|> y) that all layouts in x and y flatten to the same layout.

flatten :: DOC -> DOC
flatten NIL              =  NIL
flatten (x :<> y)        =  flatten x :<> flatten y
flatten (NEST i x)       =  NEST i (flatten x)
flatten (TEXT s)         =  TEXT s
flatten LINE             =  TEXT " "
flatten (x :<|> y)       =  flatten x

flatten (NESTING f)      =  NESTING (flatten . f)
flatten (PAD n)          =  NIL

-- Given a document, representing a set of layouts, group returns the set with one
-- new element added, representing the layout in which everything is compressed
-- on one line. This is achieved by replacing each newline (and the corresponding
-- indentation) with text consisting of a single space. (Variants might be considered
-- where each newline carries with it the alternate text it should be replaced by. For
-- instance, some newlines might be replaced by the empty text, others with a single
-- space.)

group :: DOC -> DOC
group x                  =  flatten x :<|> x

-- Finally, the function layout converts a document to a string.
-- The first parameter is the width of a tab in spaces.

layout :: Int -> Doc -> String
layout tw Nil                  =  ""
layout tw (s       `Text` x)   =  s ++ (layout tw x)
layout tw ((Fil i) `Line` x)   =  ('\n' : tabspaces tw i) ++ (layout tw x)

spaces :: Int -> String
spaces n = copy n ' '

tabspaces :: Int -> Int -> String
tabspaces tw n = (copy (n `div` tw) '\t') ++ (spaces (n `mod` tw))

copy :: Int -> Char -> String
copy i x                 =  [ x | _ <- [1..i] ]

-- Next, it is necessary to choose the best among the set of possible layouts. This
-- is done with a function best, which takes a document that may contain unions, and
-- returns a document containing no unions. A momentâ€™s thought reveals that this
-- operation requires two additional parameters: one specifies the available width
-- w, and the second specifies the number of characters k already placed on the current
-- line (including indentation).


-- Cfg is the configuration for a layout.
-- The int is the desired line length.
data Cfg = Cfg Int
-- lw accesses the line length.
lw :: Cfg -> Int
lw (Cfg x) = x

-- Cur is the current output position on the current line.
-- The int is the column number.
data Cur = Cur Int
-- cur accesses the cursor.
cur :: Cur -> Int
cur (Cur k) = k

-- Fil is the current filling at the beginning of a new line.
-- The int is the number of spaces.
data Fil = Fil Int
-- fil accesses the filling width.
fil :: Fil -> Int
fil (Fil x) = x

best :: Cfg -> DOC -> Doc
best w x               =  be w (Cur 0) [(Fil 0,x)]

be :: Cfg -> Cur -> [(Fil,DOC)] -> Doc
be w k []                          =  Nil
be w k ((i,NIL)      :z)  =  be w k z
be w k ((i,x :<> y)  :z)  =  be w k ((i,x):(i,y):z)
be w k ((i,NEST j x) :z)  =  be w k ((Fil (fil i + j),x):z)
be w k ((i,TEXT s)   :z)  =  s `Text` be w (Cur (cur k + length s)) z
be w k ((i,LINE)     :z)  =  i `Line` be w (Cur (fil i)) z
be w k ((i,x :<|> y) :z)  =  better w k (be w k ((i,x):z))
                                        (be w k ((i,y):z))
be w k ((i,COLUMN f) :z)  =  be w k ((i,(f $ cur k)):z)
be w k ((i,NESTING f):z)  =  be w k ((i,(f $ fil i)):z)

-- The two middle cases [LINE/TEXT] adjust the current position: for a newline it is set to the
-- indentation, and for text it is incremented by the string length. For a union, the
-- better of the best of the two options is selected. It is essential for efficiency that
-- the inner computation of best is performed lazily. By the invariant for unions, no
-- first line of the left operand may be shorter than any first line of the right operand.
-- Hence, by the criterion given previously, the first operand is preferred if it fits, and
-- the second operand otherwise.

better :: Cfg -> Cur -> Doc -> Doc -> Doc
better w k x y           =  if fits ((lw w)-(cur k)) x then x else y

-- If the available width is less than zero, then the document cannot fit. Otherwise,
-- if the document is empty or begins with a newline then it fits trivially, while if
-- the document begins with text then it fits if the remaining document fits in the
-- remaining space. Handling negative widths is not merely esoteric, as the case for
-- text may yield a negative width. No case is required for unions, since the function
-- is only applied to the best layout of a set.

fits :: Int -> Doc -> Bool
fits w x | w < 0         =  False
fits w Nil               =  True
fits w (s `Text` x)      =  fits (w - length s) x

-- The function fillwords takes a string, and returns a document that fills each

-- Recall that we do not expose :<|> to the user, but x <+/> y may be safely exposed,
-- because it satisfies the invariant required by :<|>. Both text " " and line
-- flatten to the same layout, and the former has a longer first line than the latter.
-- Alternatively, one can rewrite the above by noting that (text " " :<|> line)

-- A variant of fillwords is fill, which collapses a list of documents into a
-- document. It puts a space between two documents when this leads to reason-
-- able layout, and a newline otherwise. (I stole this function from Peyton Jonesâ€™s
-- expansion of Hughesâ€™s pretty printer library.)
-- Note the use of flatten to ensure that a space is only inserted between documents
-- which occupy a single line. Note also that the invariant for :<|>

-- This main function exercises the pretty printer. It accepts 4
-- command-line arguments.
--
-- The first two argument control the first phase, pretty-printing proper.
-- This first phasae always emits tab characters.
--  - the desired line width.
--  - the virtual tab width to use when producing tabs and computing
--    whether tabs fit.
--
-- The 3rd argument determines whether to apply a second phase or not.
-- If the 3rd argument is missing or empty, then the second phase
-- is not applied and the output of the first phase is printed as-is.
--
-- If the 3rd argument is specified, this enables the second phase:
-- replacing tabs by spaces as would be done by an editor or web
-- browser or terminal. The 3rd argument indicates the character to
-- replace tabs with. It defaults to a space. Recommend value: _ (to
-- see the tabs more explicitly).
--
-- If the 4th argument is specified, it determines the physical tab
-- width used by the replacement phase. If omitted, it defaults to the
-- virtual tab width (i.e. assume the input to the first phase already
-- matches the output device). This argument is meant to simulate a
-- difference between the tab width assumed by the pretty-printing
-- code and the actual tab width of a display device.
--
-- A good pretty-printing algorithm should ensure the output is
-- pleasant to read even if the two values mismatch.
